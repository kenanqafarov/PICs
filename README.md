# PİCs Library 📌

**PİCs Library** is a Python-based tool that **encrypts and decrypts text using the digits of PI**.  
The `take()` method encrypts text using PI digits, while the `shoot()` method decrypts it back to its original form.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic encryption based on PI digits**
- **Extra security through reverse-order technique**
- **PI digits fetched via HTTP API**

## 🧠 Methods Overview

- `take(text)` → Encrypts text based on PI digits and character positions  
- `shoot(encrypted_text)` → Decrypts the text by reversing the encryption steps  
- `getPI(n)` → Fetches the first `n` digits of PI via API
